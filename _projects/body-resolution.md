A lip-synced music video cover of Kate Bush’s 1979 video of her hit single Wuthering Heights using openFrameworks and GLSL, performed by me. How can two teenagers, separated by 50 years of sociopolitical context, technological advancement and the Atlantic Ocean, perform tenderness? What is my body’s resolution?

Materials: My body and face, Kate Bush’s voice, Canon DSLR camera, GLSL, openFrameworks and iMovie
