I imagine this machine, “Arthur,” scooping, gathering and processing garbage while floating in the Pacific Trash Vortex, a swirling mass of waste that has floated into the ocean and now has the same area as the state of Texas. The machine’s prospective aim is to build a foundation for a neighborhood of luxury townhouses on top of the floating garbage island.
