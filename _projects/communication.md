Language has been around since human beings learned to communicate with one another. The power of communication is vast â€” it has the seismic power to inspire and create cultural moments. Could typographic communication be brought into the physical realm, and how could it interact with its surroundings? This is a prototype that I created while thinking about this question. 

As part of my studies at the School for Poetic Computation, I created a device that could simulate this interaction using wooden cams, acrylic rods, plywood, 2812b LED strips, and openFrameworks. The motors and cams acted as devices that were making physical waves, and the mounted rods on top served as individual movable screens with individually addressable LEDs.
