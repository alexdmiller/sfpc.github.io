A collection of a thousand images have been computer generated by establishing a set of rules that define the behavior of two lines and the way they interact with each other. By selecting and arranging different snapshots in space, stories start to emerge.

Serie no. 1 was exhibited at SFPC: The first class exhibition, in Eyebeam (New York). 15 prints (9x7in), 12 feet long.
