*bitplay* is an expressive interactive audio visual instrument that allow participants to journey into the world if bit, circuit and logic. The project also served as my autobiography of my time, people I met, and things I learned during school for poetic computation in spring 2014.

- Bit field image taught by Zach Lieberman.
- One bit synthesizer from drawing and circuit class with Taeyoon Choi.
- Wearable glove switch from Kaho Abeâ€™s workshop.
- Shader code by Hiroaki Yamane, taught by Jason Levine. 

These brief moments, these bits of memory, intertwined, combined, compiled into this one project.
