A binary counter uses a neural network to learn to count. Blank clay forms represent binary digits, with a raised flag indicating one and lowered indicating zero. The learning is conducted in real time, dramatically stretching out a process that ordinarily takes hours to one that could run for months. This piece is a performance that is meant to interrogate the anxiety and wonder provoked by seeing machines get better at an elemental act of human cognition.
