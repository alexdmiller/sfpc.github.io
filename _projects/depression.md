“how can i help?”

a solitary dial reflects the machine’s physical clock speed, acting as display rather than control. despite appearances, your presence is appreciated.

depression is a personal reflection of my past few years, struggling with depression in an environment that couldn’t help or support me the way i needed. the dial represents the machine’s energy level. turned all the way down, it represents depression; the machine’s clock speed drops, and it becomes so sluggish it’s nearly inoperative. when the dial is turned all the way up, the machine works “as intended”.

over time, the machine’s clock goes through a natural ebb and flow. it’s affected by both a long-term depressive cycle, and short-term events that bump the dial in random directions. the machine tends toward the depressive, so most viewers’ initial encounter is with the depressive state.

nearly every piece in the sfpc showcase was interactive, so most viewers had the instinct to force the dial towards a “better mood”. the dial would linger briefly at its new state before two heavy motors forced it back to its initial energy level. the initial “why don’t you just cheer up?” was rebuffed. some participants moved on at this point.

but if a viewer remained present near the piece without forcing the dial, its energy level resurfaced on its own.
