Data Shift: Sensations is a reflection on how data exists and is transferred in systems and devices. Experience computational data through tactile interaction. Load the interface on your device, disconnect from the internet, and plug into the installation. See, feel, and follow your message through the system. See the physical change and space your “virtual” interactions take up in the world.

Materials: apple laptop, 4 channel audio interface, 3.5mm headphone connectors and adapters, receipt printer, plastic tubing, LED matrix display, raspberry pi, LCD display, bass actuator, bass amplifier
