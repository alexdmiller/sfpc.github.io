TASTED is a project that investigates the way we taste food and its flavor.  
Nowadays it is possible to identify a productâ€™s flavor profile through gas chromatography.  
Starting from a data set of 1000+ ingredients and their flavor compound profiles, Tasted combines ingredients in pairs resulting in over a million combinations. 
Looking for intersections of compounds between ingredients, food pairs are mapped from most similar to most dissimilar. 

On November 17th at School for Poetic Computation in Brooklyn residents, fellows and guests were invited to sample a selection of paired unprocessed ingredients (basically couples of ingredients places together in their mouth).

The Menu
A selection of 24 pairs of food (a+b) that falls into 2 categories:
(J+) the positive indicates food couples with similarity (shared flavor compounds).
(J-) the negative indicates food couples with dissimilar components.
