Text lighter is an application to take a long exposure photography of light painting using an XY-Plotter, a LED, and a DSLR. Putting a LED light instead of a pen on our plotter, it draws a shape which is sent from our application. While our plotter draw a shape, the DSLR keep opening the shutter so we can take a photo of light painting.

The first sprint for Text lighter in collaboration w/ [Jonathan Dahan](/people/Jonathan-Dahan/) was exhibited at Eyebeam art and technology center, NY during the term of The SFPC First Class Exhibition.
