*Por si seguís ahí* is a wearable device intended to find a missing family member. It’s designed around a family portrait with an empty space. The device uses a small camera to search its surroundings for people, isolating any faces that it finds and placing them within the portrait. The found faces are compared to known family members, and the similarity between them is translated into a vibrating heartbeat-like signal that the wearer feels on their chest. The higher the similarity, the faster heartbeat. The piece is intended to be an emotional and speculative piece of hardware, easing the wearer’s work of constantly looking for someone.
