An invisible narrative of ‘operating systems’ in transient spaces. Aimed to consider the relationship between the unseen work process of hotel housekeeping employees, maintaining private areas in public spaces, to unknown guests in non-places.

The intersection of those residing for short periods of time in spaces they do not own and the invisible labor of permanent housekeeping staff, silently arranging or deleting presence of strangers, interim occupants, they will never meet. Computational hotels.

Based on five years of visual documentation at a NYC hotel.
