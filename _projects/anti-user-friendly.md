The concept of ‘user friendliness’ focuses on ease of use above all else. It asks as little of the user as possible. In order to achieve this, most websites use standardized design and interface conventions that don’t require the user to learn how to use a new interface — instead, users repeat the behavior they’ve been trained to do. This automatic repetition of action causes people to lose their content awareness. In Anti User-friendly, I construct hard-to-use devices and interfaces in order to challenge the notion of user friendliness and bring back content awareness. The piece creates a situation in which users need to explore and learn before they can use the interfaces. Through this process, users are given an opportunity to become conscious again — in a way, a form of self care.
