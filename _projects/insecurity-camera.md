"The Insecurity Camera is a security camera who looks the other way. On a day to day basis we can’t avoid the gaze of security cameras and closed-circuit television monitoring us, but the Insecurity Camera doesn’t want to watch what we’re doing. It’s just as uncomfortable with you looking at it, as you probably are of it looking at you.

The camera uses an application written using the openFrameworks C++ library, running on a Raspberry Pi computer, to detect motion within its field of view. When people aren’t near and motion isn’t detected it goes about its business of surveying the area as any good camera should, but as soon as the camera sees movement it’s startled awake and a signal is sent to an Arduino microcontroller which then finds the best path to retreat away from view of the observer, and it then performs the movement using two servo motors on the pan and tilt axis."
