My grandmother in her 90s taught me how to make snowflakes using a piece of paper. I used to spend time with her playing with papers in the well-lit living room. I invite you to the beautiful part of my childhood memory. Here is the entrance, a small wooden box. Place your hand inside the wooden box and turn the knobs to feel the snow.
