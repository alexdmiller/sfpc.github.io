What does an electronic painting look like? Electronic hardware is often obscured by sleek aluminum shells, what does it mean to expose the hardware and let it speak for itself? Electronic components are not meant to be looked at, touched, or studied at length. From an engineering perspective, hardware shells protect the circuitry from dust and daily wear and tear. In the context of an electronic painting hanging on a clean gallery wall, a different set of rules apply. This sterile environment gives a platform for exposed hardware, and allows us to indulge our curiosity. Drawing on iconography from the American west, and traditional oil painting, the focal point of this piece is a double exposed image of a bucking bronco. Oscillating blue and red lights trick the eye into perceiving motion in a double exposed image of a bucking bronco. An exposed circuit board reveals the simplicity of the mechanism.
