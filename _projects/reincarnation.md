Reincarnation is an interactive piece created using Tracery grammars. Reincarnation follows the character of Ludacris as he continuously dies and returns to life. The reader is able to control the amount of violence and randomness in Ludacris's world by moving the slider from n=1 (most peaceful) to n=5 (most extreme).
