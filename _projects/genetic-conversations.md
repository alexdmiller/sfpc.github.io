The DNA of every living being is unique, it’s a code that defines the existence and particular configuration of life. Although DNA can be very different from another, it’s a language that unites us. PCR technique is used in molecular biology to obtain copies of a DNA fragment. These images consist of lines, strips going up or down depending of its molecular weight. These are similar to some sound visualizations and to perforations of a piano roll.

“Genetic conversations” proposes the possibility of a dialogue linking two living beings despite the natural communication barriers. This is created through sonify  DNA restriction patterns (PCR), shown in agarose gel.

Since SFPC, the project has evolved exploring more species DNA sounds, turned into a symphony for the sixth extinction. How could the last music we will ever write together as species is going to sound like ? How the sounds of DNA could help us to reflect about extinction?

Symphony for the sixth Extinction is a unique symphony created by living beings DNA in which one could listen to a conversation between different life forms. 
This project reproduces DNA sounds reflecting the infinite connections of life, through a perforated paper that show PCR amplified DNA fragments in agarose gel.Aims to use sound to reflect about the presence and absence of species and about the interconnections of life and her existence in earth.
