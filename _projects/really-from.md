"No, where are you really from?"

This interactive audiovisual album is a series of responses to this question and an invitation to unpack the complexity of a personal history through simple controls. Dealing with topics of solitude, dependence, and instinct, each piece is procedurally generated with JavaScript.

In the physical installation, audience members can use slide controls to manipulate the art how they see fit. In its online version, interaction utilizes mouse position to influence forms on the screen.
