In 1968, poet Hannah Weiner collaborated with the Coast Guard to use nautical signal flags, signal lamps, and Morse code to transmit works of found “Code Poems” across Central Park. No known surviving images of these performances currently exist, so on November 25th, 2019, I attempted to make some. Here’s a small sense of what it might have looked and felt like.
