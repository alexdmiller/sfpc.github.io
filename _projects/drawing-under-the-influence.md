An absolute orientation sensor turns a marker into a controller. As it grows, the drawing reveals a meditative environmental soundscape in real-time. The sonic palette is a collection of site-specific field-recordings captured around The School for Poetic Computation, throughout the spring session. From rain on the courtyard outside, to motors from hardware class, to the sounds of people typing away on their computers. The performance is an exploration of the relationship between memory, sound, and emotion.

Materials: Acrylic Marker, built-in Absolute Orientation Sensor, Arduino Software, Max 8, and Paper.
