“The pen plotter is creating a drawing today. Let it work in peace. Artists need to focus.”  *I’ll Show You When I’m Finished* is a performance by a computer and a robotic drawing machine. Lines are drawn in real time while the computer randomly executes rules for splitting a page of triangles into smaller and smaller shapes. Thousands of triangles eventually form a unique composition. 

Materials: openFrameworks, AxiDraw v3, pens, paper
