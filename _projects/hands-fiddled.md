A networked diptych where performers on either side record a gesture. The two terminals are in different rooms. The gestures recorded from each terminal are composed together in a dance that persistently loops on screen. A previous gesture is overwritten when a new one is recorded. Whether a gesture is live or a looping memory is unknown from the other side. Hands Fiddled is a machine in between intimacy and memory.
