*Held* is a deployable space that uses a reactive inflatable to invoke feelings of safety, comfort, and security. The piece invites the participant to "Come in!" and have a seat. They find themselves in a quiet corner— a refuge from the social anxiety and expected networking of a gallery opening. When a participant presses their hand to the window, their touch is sensed. The space responds without hesitation— meeting the participant in a large inflatable hug. Like a mother's urgent embrace, Held is a space meant to provide immediate comfort, safety, and protection.

Materials: Plastic sheet, Fan, Arduino, Capacitive Sensor, Craft Iron, Headphones, Chocolate.
