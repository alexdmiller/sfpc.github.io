title: Devices To Communicate With Nothing
artist:  kelly-monson

We don't really think about how our interfaces work the way they do, we take them for granted as magic black boxes. As communication through our objects becomes more seamless and obfuscated with increasingly elaborate engineering, the occasional glitch will frustrate and confuse us. With devices like these I attempt to create surreal interfaces in an effort to show what it might be like to use something badly designed that has no discernible function.
