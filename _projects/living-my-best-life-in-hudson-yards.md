The story of a fool in a smart city. *Living My Best Life in Hudson Yards* depicts true events of the artist visiting New York’s newest, most expensive, smartest neighborhood – from the QR code unlocking shower in the mall, to the mediocre view from atop the Vessel. Captured entirely on a cellphone, the film is a project of self-surveillance, a glimpse into our glorious future where no scrap of data is wasted.
