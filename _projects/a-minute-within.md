Participants are asked to tap a button every second throughout a minute, using their own perception of time as reference. Timestamps are visualised on a 'soft' clock, warping the time intervals based on the participant's input. The color palette is taken from leaves picked under the same tree during fall. The diversity of colors suggests that each leaf follows a different scale of time, or perhaps a different pace of living.
