Reality® is an immersive installation for a single person at a time. It creates a space that lets the viewer experience the collective reaction to the 2016 election in the US. It is a meditation on the feelings of anxiety surrounding it. An audio reading of a fictional anti-anxiety medication is accompanied by video composed of photos that I took during the time of the election when people put up post-its with their grievances and fears in New York’s Union Square station. People opened up about their vulnerabilities in this transient emergent space. With this piece, I wish to create a dialogue about these collective feelings.

Materials: Election, Union Square Station, ImageMagick, gif, voice recording
