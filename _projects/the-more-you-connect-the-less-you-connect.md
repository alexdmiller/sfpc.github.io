This piece is about memory’s fragmented nature. Two separated 4:3 monitors on the wall are linked by 5 interchangeable banana plugs. The screen on the left shows raw footage from a VHS family video from 1992, and on one side of the monitor’s frame 5 color sockets stand as sources, where each source is a member of the family in the video. The screen on the right is a mirror of the left screen, where each socket stands as an input for these family members, and each input represents a memory mechanism, or a memory ‘process’. The user is in charge of connecting each member of the family on the left with a different process on the right and creating a collage of modified memories on the right screen, by filtering the content, reordering the frames, and erasing faces in real time. The screen on the left represents the unaltered past, and the screen on the right represents the way we tend to remember things. The more you connect the less you connect is an interactive meditation on childhood and memory mechanisms, distorted by computer vision scripts, colored cables and sorting algorithms.
