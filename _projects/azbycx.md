Azbycx is a Python program that rearranges samples from videofiles following a sorting algorithm, mixing the beggining and the ending. The result is an automatic found footage avant-garde shortfilm that would take hundred of hours of manual work: an audiovisual experience that lets the viewer watch the beggining and the ending of a story, all at the same time.
