*1010* is a representation of decimal time. Two incandescent lightbulbs cycle up and down at different rates behind heat-sensitive pigment, leaving temporary trails of white. The objects on the lower altar are a nod to the decimalized French Republican calendar, which designated a name from the rural economy for each day. The SFPC showcase took place on December 1 and 2, or Frimaire 11 and 12 â€” Wax and Horseradish.

Materials: incandescent lightbulbs, thermochromic pigment, acrylic medium, stepper motors, arduino, candles, horseradish root
