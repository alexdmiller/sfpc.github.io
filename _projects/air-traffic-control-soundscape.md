*Air Traffic Control Soundscape* uses procedurally generated sounds using SuperCollider, while a live air traffic control radio is played over internet streams. A microcontroller allows listeners to switch the stations, and lights the bulb above the clock of the active channel’s airport. The piece creates a space for the listener to reflect– while being acutely aware of the present. The instructions for the visitors are to “stop reading this, relax, and listen.”
