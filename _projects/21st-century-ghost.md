As I broadcast and transmit through different channels online, I contribute to the fabrication of an alien or machinic entity of my lived experiences, materialising and updating within virtual space. In the event of my death, my virtual body becomes “memorialised” by default, prolonging interaction with other users, contributing more data to be analysed to the social network’s profit. This is an altar to offer my virtual body anything it might want in the afterlife. Please place a stick of incense in the corresponding cup to make your offering.

Materials: Cement, incense, rice, arduino, raspberry pi, piezo sensors, tablet
