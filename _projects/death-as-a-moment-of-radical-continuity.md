*Death as a Moment of Radical Continuity* is a counter-narrative that leverages memory as a form of resistance to interrogate the cultural value systems encoded into the objects that we build. The eight-shelled Opele (Yorùbá — Nigeria) is an apparatus for divination through collective memory. It has a binary implementation not unlike the computer byte: a single unit of machine memory that contains 8-bits and can store 256 different values (0-255). While computer memory has a finite capacity through manufactured scarcity, the divination chain has boundless potential. It extends itself from a physical mechanism into a field of ritualized practice that has the ability to be recast to unearth an unlimited number of interpretations depending on the context.
