An experiment in vulnerability. Reality is messy and complicated. We are messy and complicated. What happens when we choose to sit with our immediate experience and devote attention to the reality within and without?

A closet in the exhibit space was appropriated to create a cozy, alternate space that people could hang out in to momentarily escape the exhibition. Participants were let in one a time and were invited to take as much time as they wanted in the room, and to write down a secret on a piece of paper before leaving. By the end of the showcase, the room was full of secrets.
