We were given is a sculptural electronic circuit. The interactive installation is composed of three main parts: a microcontroller (which is the centre and  brain of the circuit), a combination of infrared emitter and receiver on one side, and a matrix of UV LEDS controlled by a multiplexer on the other side. When somebody interrupts the communication between the infrared emitter and the receiver, the UV LED matrix shines light on a text written with invisible ink, making it readable. This circuit is the physical manifestation of an emotional and psychological process I recently experienced. It narrates the powerful healing force derived from the severing of deep, yet harmful relationships. In the making of this work I discovered an exciting expressive medium and I plan to make a whole new series of sculptural circuits during the next few months.

Materials: Brass rods, UV LEDs, resistors, SN74HC595N multiplexer, micro-controller, 2,159 bytes of code, infra-red emitter and receiver, invisible ink, paper, mirrors.
