ROBOSAMO(c) is a a poetry generator based on the “SAMO(c)” graffiti series by Al Diaz and Jean-Michel Basquiat. It generates new unique SAMO(c) statements by combining components from a historical log of SAMO(c) statements. Originally presented in a terminal-style presentation at SFPC, the project evolved into custom hand-written cards as part of The Cards Project.
