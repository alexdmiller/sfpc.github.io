Time Portraitures features a pair of slow clocks: one that stops when unveiled, another submerged in oil. Two precarious pulses embody the trauma and erosion of life that emerges from their consumption. Static and silent at first glance, each cadence can only be discerned if you give it time and listen closelyâ€”a quiet call for patience and intimacy in order to be known. 

Materials: analog clocks, arduino, photoresistor, mineral oil, birch wood, glass, black velvet
