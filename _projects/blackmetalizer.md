Black Metal it is intended to be one of the most extreme (in darkness, obscurity, evilness and brutality ) sub-genre of Metal Music; as such, the logos of the Black Metal bands.
Probably in search of such extremes the logos, as well as the music, have become absolutely unreadable. Text turned into just a bunch of apparently random lines that usually look like a texture rather than something written.

By using this Black Metal styled generative typography anyone can create a text that resembles a Black Metal logo, which will be deprived from its original intentions and meaning, only left with its formal attributes. It will be culturally resignified as a message carrier which unfortunately will loose the message -the text- thanks to its inherent unintelligibility leaving it to be resignified, once again, just as an aesthetic form. It is a funny yet compelling sabotage to the self-sabotage of Black Metal bands logos.
