A kinetic origami sculpture, created at the School for Poetic Computation, exhibited at the 2018 Spring showcase.

The intention of this project was to focus on process and exploration; revisiting an old interest in Origami through the lens of computational geometry. The folded pattern is known as the Water Bomb tessellation, discovered by Ron Resch, and is a kind of meta-material — exhibiting properties that are not inherently present in the paper itself — such as the compression along one axis leads to the expansion along another.

The piece was folded from a 4ft x 3ft sheet of paper, which was then cut into 2 parts to make folding more manageable. This process took approximately 20 hours.
