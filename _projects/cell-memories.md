Physarum polycephalum over cell phone, digital microscope over screen.

In this work I present an edit of recently digitized family videos playing on my own cell phone, its screen covered by a grown physarum polycephalum mould. I offer two scales of this object.
The naked eye sees a moving image, the unfolding childhood memories in my two favorite places while the mould appears still. The endoscope image inverts this relationship. My memories stand still as pixels seem static, varying in brightness only. The mould reveals endless paths of memory, places it will never return to.

Memory is survival. It is the exercise of recalling to understand change and permanence. It reconsiders scales, relationships, gestures, words. I believe in identity as an emergent behaviour from memories. In the same way as the projected image, we constitute ourselves according to the places we have been in.
How do memories emerge as a juxtaposition of nature and technology?
