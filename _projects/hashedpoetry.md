\#hashedpoetry is an another method of giving a gift.
Hashing a gift means almost all of the information will be lost.
But even after hashing, the uniqueness of the original still remains.
And sometimes it can remind you of something stronger.
Hashed poetry is a method so you can create your hashed poem.
Only one thing you have to do is hashing.

This time I did...

- wrote a poem for each cohort and hashed them into 24bit value.
- read them as color code(RRGGBB)
- created wooden coins and painted them each color
(below are not included in the video)
- gave them to cohorts and had each to write down short message into the sheet
- took a photo of the sheet
- got my color by hashing the image data
- created a final coin for me
